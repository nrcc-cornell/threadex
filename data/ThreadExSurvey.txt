2005-11-22 11:51:22.27	CYS	no	I am concerned when stations start getting pieced together like this.  Check Steve Doty's work for where this station has migrated in the past.  I think there is a strong potential for such stations and records to be misused by people who may not be aware of all the changes in location and the ramifications of such moves.  I believe that the Cheyenne station has been in 6 different locations in the time of the proposed "thread"  During that time, instrument locations have been both on roofs and at ground level.  We have to be very careful of this given the intense focus of the media and others on things like global warming etc	no adddata response	no addcomments	Tony Bergantino	Wyoming State Climate Office	tony@wrds.uwyo.edu

I would thread the Minneapolis Downtown record from 1/1/1891 to 1pm on April 9th, 1938 when the official record was transferred to the Minneapolis/St Paul airport.	yes	The St. Paul Signal Service record can extend this thread back further to July 1877 for Max/Min temperature and to January 1872 for precipiation.

2005-11-23 11:13:22.45	FLG	no	The actual data records prior to Sept 9, 1898 have not been examined at the local office, in fact we were all surprised to see there actually was data before this official date of our first weather records. Examination of this data prior to Sept 8, 1898 suggests that it is very erroneous, with some months having all time record temperatures which we do not believe and would not want to include in our data set. We would like to see the threaded data set for Flagstaff start on Sept 8, 1898 and continue to the present.	yes	We have a complete data thread from Sept 9, 1898 through the current time with very little missing data that was quality controlled against the hand written records which is current in XMClimate on AWIPS. This, as far as we are concerned, is the best threaded record for the city of Flagstaff. We'd be more than happy to supply it to you.	Michael Staudenmaier	WFO Flagstaff	michael.staudenmaier@noaa.gov
2005-11-23 11:13:22.45	INW	no	We have the same concerns with the data prior to 1915 for Winslow that we had for Flagstaff early records. The data prior to 1915 are full of errors, have many missing periods and dates, and would not be useful in a meaningful sense to the more continous record after October 1915. We'd like to see the thread start at January 1915, and blend with the airport data that starts on 10/29/31 and continue to the present time.  	no	no addcomments	Michael Staudenmaier	WFO Flagstaff	michael.staudenmaier@noaa.gov

Also, there is another LCD site called Yuma, AZ which we would like to have threaded (desribed in the box below). 	yes	For Phoenix, we would like to extend the record back in time by using the original Weather Bureau site in downtown Phoenix (WBAN 93140).  This was the official Weather Bureau site from 1895-1953 before the office moved to Sky Harbor Airport. We have the data in xmClimate (netCDF) and in an Excel spreadsheet.  For Yuma, AZ there is a similar situation.  The original Weather Bureau site was downtown (WBAN 93145) from Jan 1893 - Jul 1949.  Weather Bureau observations were also taken at the Yuma International Airport beginning in 1948 and continued until November 1995 (WBAN 23915). From December 1995 - present, observations at the same airport have been taken by the U.S. Marine Corps (WBAN 03145).

There actually is an older Redding City data set, but it was not compatable to the airport, which is higher and out to the east by several miles. In fact, we "unthreaded" these two data sets when we went to the AWIPS CLI program (which uses the Redding ASOS data). I believe we have sold our customers on the idea of separate climate records.

2005-12-06 14:50:08.58	LSE	no	We propose that the last date for 474375 would be 12/31/1950 and the beginning date for 474370 would be 1/1/1951.  This would match our local data base and also the monthly data that NCDC used for the transition between these 2 locations.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Jeff Boyne	NWS ARX	Jeff.Boyne@noaa.gov

2005-12-06 21:34:57.62	APN	no	Not as is.  Data from KAPN could only date back to 1948.  The only location that could support a begin date that old would be the Alpena waste water treatment plant.  These two locations are FAR from compatable.  It appears in the xmACIS database, that this threading has already taken place.  With a little more research, we MAY (I stress MAY) be able to thread these two...but it would have to be looked at, and WELL documented.  PLEASE contact me with any questions...or before proceeding.	no	no addcomments	Keith Berger	NWS- KAPX	keith.berger@noaa.gov
2005-12-06 21:34:57.62	HTL	yes	Actually...these have already been "Threaded" in our AWIPS database...through in err.  I just dicovered this "thread" and was trying to decide whether to "Un-thread" them or not.  This project can convince me to let them be.  However...it must be stressed that there is a big Micro-climate issue that effects this situation.  KHTL, located on the northeast side of Houghton Lake will never get warm enough to break any of the old records from 6 WSW...which is upstream from the lake and doesn't get the cooling effect.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Keith Berger	NWS- KAPX	keith.berger@noaa.gov

Why this data isn't at NCDC is another question?? This is the paper format and I will try to get it into digital form and forward it.The station history at NCDC indicates data back to 1929. Where your thread to 1923 comes from I don't know. Once I forward the data from 1935 onward, the thread should run from then to the present.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Bud Dietzmann	NWSFO Melbourne FL	Francis.Dietzmann@noaa.gov
2005-12-07 20:29:35.37	MCO	no	The original NWS station was at KORL starting in 1944, which was then known as Herndon Airport,WBAN#12841. NCDC station history shows back to 1 APR 1929 as COOP but don't know where this data can be found. There was also an AAF at this site from 1 JUN 1941 to 31 OCT 1949, data whereabouts unknown(WBAN#12824). The NWS moved from KORL to KMCO in Jan 1974 and for some reason the data for KMCO is not to be found from Jan 1974 to Feb 1976. dat for KORL is avaiable for this period and could be used. Will try and extract some sense to the data from NCDC CD TD3200, and just might be able to fill in the blanks. This thread combining KMCO and KORL should be condatant from at least 1944 to the present.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Bud Dietzmann	NWSFO Melbourne FL	Francis.Dietzmann@noaa.gov

KVRB data OK from 11/1/1942 to 9/30/1965, then went bellyup until restarting on 1/01/1984 and continues to the present. This data gap should be filled by using the COOP station VRBF1(089219).Will have to try and get data from TD3200 and may be able to run thread back to 1931.

2005-12-09 11:58:04.47	RAP	no accept response	Received via e-mail: The Rapid City Airport "thread" has the Airport record from Jan 1949 to present. The Weather Bureau moved their official instrument (triple register) from their in-town office to the Municipal Airport (Now Ellsworth AFB) on July 29th, 1942. Then the office and instrumentation was moved to the new airport (Rapid City Regional) on Oct. 5th, 1950. The two sites (old and new airport) are only 7 miles apart, 40 feet in elevation difference, and both sit on atop an east-west ridge just east of the Black Hills, so the weather records can be considered climatologically similar. This would extend the Airport record back to July 29th, 1942.     In addition, the Weather Bureau maintained equipment in downtown Rapid City through April 11th, 1972. In Nov 1995, the new NWS office was finished just above the SD School of Mines and Technology, and began official weather observations starting Jan 1996. So the downtown Rapid City record spans Jan 1888 through Apr 11th, 1971, and then from Jan 1996 to present.  It is our recommendation that we align these two climate stations (Rapid City and Rapid City Airport) with the time periods mentioned above. The Rapid City office has the additional data required to extend the Rapid City Airport record and establish the Rapid City record in Excel format.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Lee Czepyha	NWS Rapid City	lee.czepyha@noaa.gov

However, the archived info. is in a written/hardbook format, and not available in digital format (on a computer). However, according to an old 1966 annual LCD for SHV, NCDC already has the correct SHV LCD locations which produced the pre-1930 data (in comparison with the written hardbook copy). Thus, I would assume that NCDC would also have the climatological data for all of the SHV locations/time periods (1871-1930) as well.  This would include daily high/low temperatures, rainfall, snowfall, wind, pressure, monthly data, etc. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

2006-01-25 14:36:25.67	APN	no accept response	It appears that the data in TD3206 and TD3205 were keyed with the wrong coop id. The Wastewater Treadment Plant and old WBO data should probably have the id 200169. This would cover the period 10/1916 through 4/1948. The airport data would then be 5/1948 through present. Since it might be a major undertaking to get the id changed, I'm hoping that for now you'll be able to approve this unintended threading that has already taken place. In the meantime, we'll work on getting the id changed and the thread correctly documented.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Keith Eggleston	NRCC	kle1@cornell.edu

2006-01-25 16:19:50.35	ABQ	yes	While we like to have as much data available as possible, it's important to note that the station was moved fairly often during the period listed above.  More importantly, the elevation varied by as much as 36o feet.  If we make this one long thread official, we will likely never break a min temp again because some of this historical data was much closer to the river valley, with more cold drainage that we record here.  What we liked to do in xmclimate was to keep two sets of records, one with the shorter time period but less (or no) movement of the site, and a second which we would call "historical" with stations combined. 	yes	I'm not sure, and will need to look.

2006-01-25 16:19:50.35	ROW	yes	My understanding is that for overlap periods you will use the data from the most recent site.  In this case, KROW starts at 1949, but the years from 67-72 are missing.  So, I guess you will use the municiple AP from 1983-1949, then again from 67-72?  Even though these sites are close, with little variation in elevation, for the overlap period a 3-6 degree temperature difference is not uncommon.	no	no addcomments	Deirdre Kann	ABQ	deirdre.kann@noaa.gov

2006-01-27 13:21:47.73	ABQ	no accept response	What we have in the database is the same as NCDC - 1/1897 to present. I believe the early part of the record came from Ken Kunkel's work. All the data  has been archived with the coop id 290234. I believe that for some of the keying projects, data was just keyed under the current station id, instead of researching to see if a different id was more appropriate.        ThreadEx is intended to be the official record for extremes. It is NOT intended to be used for research purposes. Ideally, the record for 290234 should probably be split, with the data from other incompatible locations assigned a different id. This would provide a homogeneous dataset for research and comparison purposes.

I had no idea there were there. We seem to have the 50s and roughly 1896 through 1915.  Anyway, there seems little doubt Grand Island can go back to August 1896.  That seems to be where our office has gotten the pre-1900 data for GRI."

2006-02-01 13:18:48.92	BUF	no	We have daily data...max/min temps/pcpn for Buffalo back to 1873...in old books stored in our office.  There should be major break in the data here though....on June 1, 1943 we moved the observation site to the airport...which is 9 miles inland from the previous downtown site (along the lakeshore). The data is unrepresentative...with averages as much as 5 degrees different for maxes in spring and summer. So I feel the record data should be restricted to 6/1/43 and on for the current site. But...we have a lot of valuable historical data from the downtown site...again from 1873 to 1943 in our office.	yes	See above.	Steve McLaughlin	BUF	stephen.mclaughlin@noaa.gov

2006-02-03 14:40:11.25	BDR	no	We are concerned about temperature differences and possible precipitation differences between these two sites which we have found to be approximately 5 miles apart and over 120 feet elevation difference. The location of Sikorsky on a peninsula that extends into Long Island Sound makes it ideal for seabreezes and marine layers. The inland location at an elevation of 141 feet will be quite different temperature-wise and could also see increased precipitation due to orographic effects.	no adddata response	no addcomments	John Koch	NWS WFO OKX	John.Koch@noaa.gov

2006-02-06 21:15:41.38	DFW	no	The updates look good.  However, there is now no data in the thread 1898-1946.  Based on the period of record for "Greater Southwest," I assume the Fort Worth data of interest is included there...09/01/1898 to 09/02/1946.  Greater Southwest (call sign = GSW) was only in existence 1953-1974.  I assume any available downtown Fort Worth records, which began 09/01/1898, are in the Greater Southwest file (which goes back to 1897)?  There is no overlap prior to 1946, so please use whatever is available.	no	no addcomments	Daniel Huckaby	NWS Fort Worth	danielhuckaby@yahoo.com

2006-02-14 13:26:13.73	GRR	no accept response	First, sure we can send you Post Office data to 1941, then Airport data from 1941 through 1945.  However, I am confused by your last message, maybe you could clear this up for me. Did you mean you had NO DATA from 1903 to 1945 or did you mean you have only Post Office data for GRR from 1903 to 1945?    I have looked in WSSRD and it seemed to me all of the GRR data from the Post Office is in fact there.          Anyway either way, we do have GRR MI Airport data back to 1941. If you want that, we surely can send it to you.  If you want the Post Office data from 1903 to 1941, we can and will sent that to you also.  We do want to help you as much as we can.           Our issue mostly is which location to use when.   I believe, based on Media input we want, Airport data from 1941 (which is in our xmClimate) on.  The LCD for GRR indicated Airport data goes back to 1930.  However most of our summer time high temperature records were set in the 1930s.  If we change sites from the post office, which is down town, 70 feet off the ground, to the airport, which is away from the city heat island and on the roof of a building down town Grand Rapids, I have to believe many of those all time records would change.  That is just what media has indicated to us they do not want.          We are missing a few months in either 1946 though for the airport.  Even so, you have that data based on you email, so that is no issue.  If you want the Airport data from 1941 to 1945 we send it to you, like we sent the Lansing data to you. We can also send you the Post Office from 1903 to 1941 too if you need that.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Willliam Marino (via e-mail)	NWS GRR	William.Marino@noaa.go

January 15 Record High should be 70 degrees in 2006 (last month). Thread ex has 65 in 1944.  June 12 Record High should be 107 in 1933. Threadex says 108. I have only been able to find 107 degrees at the USDA climate publication and on NCDC the special observers form. Our records indicated a temperature of 107.   August 3 Record High should be 111 in 1918. On WSSRD I found the high of 111 degrees (adjusted as said on the form)on the COOP observation. I also found a high of 109 on the NCDC site special obs form. The record high in threadex is 107 in 1930. It should be at least 109 if not 111.   October 14 record should be 89 in 1918. I found on WSSRD in the COOP form a high 89 degrees. I found 88 on the special obs form at NCDC. We also have a record high of 89 in 1897 (data sent in but not included in this treadex).   For October 22, we will use 91 for our record high set in 1899. This data has been sent in but was included in this threadex.

2006-03-03 22:21:52.64	GRI	no accept response	These comments pertain to the threadex data for daily High low temperatures (warm minimums) for Grand Island only.     March 3 should be 42 in 1920. Found on obs. form.   March 21 should be 54 in 1911. Found on obs form. It was 51 in 1910 not 57.   April 16 should be 58 in 1985. Found on LCD.   April 17 should be 64 in 1985. Found on LCD.   June 26 should be 76 in 1991. Found on LCD. The 77 on in 1936 was on the 25th.   August 6 should be 80 in 1918. Found on obs form.     We have 83 for August 5 in 1918. I honestly can not read the form but the form says the thermometer was unreliable and the USDA data was blank. You number for August 5 looks fine.     The remaining days are changes using the pre-1900 data already submitted.     January 22 shoudlbe 35 in 1899.   February 14 should be 37 in 1898.   August 31 should be 78 in 1898.

2006-03-04 00:08:18.68	CNK	no accept response	Didn't have time to check all Threaded extreme data, but saw most problems around 1948 -- the year when a station move occurred.  Two Topeka stations were listed in the "Climatological Data for the U.S" for portions of the year, but not until after the dates listed.  Discrepancies between the ThreadEx data and the 1948 CDs were found for: max temps on 2/18, 3/9, and 3/11 and min temps on 1/8, 1/28, 3/10, 3/11, and 3/12.  Other problems were noted in checking with LCD data for the max temp on 12/3/1998 and the min temp on 2/18/1997.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Kyle Poage	TOP	kyle.poage@noaa.gov

2006-03-09 00:24:59.58	GUM	no accept response	Keith,  I want to make sure that the period of record pertains to the current site.  Until 1995, this site was Naval Air Station Agana.  The NWS site was several miles north at Finagayan.  Since 1995, the NWS site has been located at the old NAS site.  This isn't apparent from the period of record data.	no adddata response	no addcomments	Chip Guard	WFO Guam	chip.guard@noaa.gov
